### University of Health Sciences Vocabulary App
http://www.vocab.us/

ສະບາຍດີ, I teach medical English at the University of Health Sciences in Vientiane, Laos. There is a lack of uniformity
in English to Lao dictionaries, physical or digital. These dictionaries generally do not include technical 
terminology. This problem led to confusion as the students would be consulting different dictionaries in and 
out of class. The creation of this app goes side by side with the creation of a new curriculum for the English 
program at the University. The app will give the future medical professionals of Laos the uniformity in medical 
terminology they need to efficiently study.

### Summary
The app is meant for students of the English program and their teachers. Students can access vocabulary they 
are responsible for by class(year 1, 2, or 3) and part(prefix, root, suffix). The teachers can add words as
they see fit. Currently, there are five teachers in the English program that will be given the "secret" required
to add words to the app. The database will be updated as the curriculum is updated, and any placeholder text will
be replaced. The app will eventually be primarily Lao in language. ໂຊກດີ!
