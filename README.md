### uhs-vocab-app - a project that brought together everything I had been learning about node. 
I teach medical English at the University of Health Sciences in Vientiane, Laos. There is a lack of uniformity
in English to Lao dictionaries, physical or digital. These dictionaries generally do not include technical 
terminology. This problem led to confusion as the students would be consulting different dictionaries in and 
out of class. The creation of this app goes side by side with the creation of a new curriculum for the English 
program at the University. The app will give the future medical professionals of Laos the uniformity in medical 
terminology they need to efficiently study.
